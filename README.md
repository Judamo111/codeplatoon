# An Armstrong Number is an N-digit number that is equal to the sum of the Nth powers of its digits.
# An example is all single digit numbers. Take 5 for example. 5 is a single digit and 5^1 is equal to 5,
# therefore it is an Armstrong number.
# Write a program in Python and Javascript to find all Armstrong numbers in the range of 0 and 999.
#  The function should take in a list/array of numbers from 0-999 and return a list of Armstrong numbers.
# Don't forget to run the tests!
